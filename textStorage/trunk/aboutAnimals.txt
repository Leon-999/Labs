Tracking Asian Great Bustards
Tuesday April 23, 2013

A recent study has revealed that the Asian subspecies of great bustard, one of the world's heaviest birds, migrates over 2,000 miles round-trip between its breeding grounds in northern Mongolia and its winter range in Shaanxi province, China. The discovery was made by a team of scientists led by Arizona State University biologist Mimi Kessler. 

The research team spent two years in Eurasian grasslands studying many aspects of the great bustards' biology including the birds' habitat use, population genetics, causes of mortality and migration routes. Kessler and colleages carefully captured and fitted several great bustards with GPS transmitters so they could track the birds' migratory routes and for the first time find out how far the various populations of great bustards travelled each year. 

They discovered that the various subspecies migrate different distances based on the climates they inhabit. The great bustards that live in Spain migrate less than a dozen miles each year; those in western Russia migrate about 600 miles each way between winter and breeding seasons. The Asian great bustards that breed in Mongolia, are the longest migrating subspecies, covering an impressive 1200 miles each way between breeding and wintering grounds. 

Male Asian great bustards can weigh up to 35 pounds, while females are much smaller, weighing up to 11 pounds. The Asian subspecies is threatened and is declining due to poaching for sport and meat. They also face threats along their migratory route due to collissions with power lines and cables.
